   <li> Fixed a few bugs that I never knew about
      <subli> <var:player:*> was actually checking the triggering client's player inside Player -> VCE_ifVariable
      <subli> Client -> VCE_modVariable & VCE_ifVariable was mistaking the client you were trying to change the variable on for for the processing/triggering client
      <subli> Fixed ifHost replacer
   <li> If the minimum number or max number is not set for the Random variable modding method it will now set it to a random float instead

      <subli> VCE_modVariable variable names accept variable replacers, ifVariable, etc
   <li> Removed annoying "This server has VCE %version" message
      <subli> If you still want it you can set $Pref::Client::ShowVCEHandshake to 1 or look in the console as it says it in there when you join a server
Version 6.01 (Stable):
   <li> Fixed enabling and disabling events
Version 6.00 (Stable, Private Beta):
   <li> You can now directly modify certain special replacers, changes will be applied to a handling function
      <subli> (meaning if you change "clanPrefix" it will automatically call a function and apply your changes, ie. set their clan prefix)
      <subli> <var:client:clanPrefix>, <var:client:clanSuffix>
      <subli> <var:client:decal>, <var:client:face>
      <subli> <var:player:health>, <var:player:damage>, <var:player:energy>, <var:player:vel> (x, y, z)
      <subli> <var:player:currentItem>, <var:player:item1> -> <var:player:item5>
      <subli> <var:brick:colorid>, <var:brick:printcount>, <var:brick:printname>
      <subli> <var:brick:name>, <var:brick:colorfxid>, <var:brick:printid>, <var:brick:shapefxid>
      <subli> <var:vehicle:health>, <var:vehicle:damage>
   <li> Sub data can now contain logic
      <subli> ~= 2 -- processes all event lines that have a 2 in their digits (2, 12, 20, 21, 22, ...)
      <subli> != 2 -- processes all event lines except 2 (0, 1, 3, 4, ...)
      <subli> == 2 -- processes only event line 2 (2)
      <subli> >= 2 -- processes all event lines larger than/equal to 2 (2, 3, 4, 5)
      <subli> > 2 -- processes all event lines smaller than 2 (0, 1)
      <subli> <= 2 -- processes all event lines smaller than/equal to 2 (0, 1, 2)
   <li> You can now use | and & in ifVariable and ifValue. & for an AND operator and | for an OR operator.
      <subli> Example <var:client:score> & <var:client:bl_id> == 1337
         <subli>Computes to: Is the client's score and bl_id equal to 1337?
   <li> Bug fixes
      <subli> There was a massive bug in VCE_stateFunction (mindless copy pasta is not good)
      <subli> Other bug fixes I can't remember
   <li> Seperated the code into seperate files for easier reading
      <subli> All of the code is pretty easy to look at, if you want to learn something
         <subli> Except for outputs.cs... it's as dirty as Clockturn's mum
   <li> Increased all VCE output events' textbox character limit
   <li> Manual now caches to make reading the manual faster
   <li> Avoided adding the 3rd client tab... again :D
Version 5.81 (Stable):
   <li> VERY important bug fix
Version 5.8 (Stable):
   <li> Added new replacers for the client target (decal,face,chest,hip,hat,accent,rleg,rarm,lleg,larm)
   <li> Added new replacer for the player target (speed)
   <li> Added new global replacers (hour,minute,second... good for real-time clocks)
Version 5.7 (Stable):
   <li> Fixed centerprintall and bottomprintall so that %1 works
   <li> Made VCE_ifVariable and VCE_modVariable for minigames
   <li> <var:vehicle:maxhealth>,<var:vehicle:health>,<var:global:brickcount>
   <li> <var:brick:ownername>, <var:brick:ownerbl_id>, <var:client:brickcount>, <var:player:energy>
Version 5.61 (Stable):
   <li> Made it so all inputs have a bot target
      <subli> The bot target will only work on vehicle spawns
   <li> Some other minor stuff I can't remember
Version 5.6 (Stable):
   <li> Added onVariableUpdate. Triggered when VCE_modVariable is called on the brick, or when a varlink is clicked.
   <li> Added <varlink:linkname_varname:value> for having links that you can click to set variables. 
      <subli> For example, <varlink:Click here_gold:1> will appear as a blue "Click here" link, which when clicked will set the client's "gold" variable to 1. Use with onVariableUpdate to do something when the client's click the link.
Version 5.5 (Stable):
   <li> Added <var:client:clanPrefix> and <var:client:clanSuffix> - self explanatory
   <li> Added ~= logic operator for every variable check. It checks if the value you enter on the right side of the operator is inside the value on the left side
      <subli> 100 ~= 10; will trigger onVariableTrue because 10 is inside the string of 100
   <li>Added VCE_retroCheck output for bricks. For all you whiners for lack of if* events. Has all of the old if* events in one event
Version 5.43 (Stable):
   <li> Fixed %1 not working in minigames
